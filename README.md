For this week's assignment, we were to keep using the MVC model we were introduced. We were to also begin using the URL as our navigation, instead of relying on the button nav. Our assignment was to create a site with at least 5 pages that showed we understood how to use both methods we were taught.

I decided to continue using the same album from Bad Bunny that I used last week. I liked the concept a lot and I had a lot of fun with it, so I added some more songs and made this site. The only thing I struggled with was remembering how to properly program the URL navigation, just because last week's code walkthrough left me a bit confused. I think I got the hang of it, but I need to practice more.
